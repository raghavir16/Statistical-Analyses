# Statistical-Analyses

This repository contains the statistical analysis of kittiwake data. The analysis explores observational, historical, measurement, and location-based data for two sub-species of kittiwakes: black-legged and red-legged. Key insights include:

1. Exploratory analysis of observational data and confidence interval construction.
2. Evaluation of trends in historical data and estimation of breeding pair numbers.
3. Visual and statistical summaries of measurement data, including independence and comparative tests between sub-species.
4. Linear modeling of location data to predict breeding pair numbers and assess the impact of environmental factors.
